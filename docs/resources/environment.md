# Resource `runscope_environment`

An [environment](https://www.runscope.com/docs/api/environments) resource.
An [environment](https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/environments)
is is a group of configuration settings (initial variables, locations,
notifications, integrations, etc.) used when running a test.
Every test has at least one environment, but you can create additional
environments as needed. For common settings (base URLs, API keys)
that you'd like to use across all tests within a bucket,
use a [Shared Environment](https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/environments#shared).

## Example Usage

### Creating a shared environment

> Note: to create a shared environment you do not include a `test_id`

```hcl
data "runscope_integration" "pagerduty" {
    team_uuid = "870ed937-bc6e-4d8b-a9a5-d7f9f2412fa3"
    type      = "pagerduty"
}

resource "runscope_environment" "environment" {
  bucket_id = runscope_bucket.bucket.id
  name      = "shared-environment"

  integrations = [
    data.runscope_integration.pagerduty.id
  ]

  initial_variables = {
    var1 = "true"
    var2 = "value2"
  }
}
```
### Creating a test environment

> Note: to create an environment specific to a test include the associated `test_id`

```hcl
# Create a bucket
resource "runscope_bucket" "main" {
    name      = "terraform-ftw"
    team_uuid = "870ed937-bc6e-4d8b-a9a5-d7f9f2412fa3"
}

data "runscope_integration" "pagerduty" {
  team_uuid = "194204f3-19a3-4ef7-a492-b14a277025da"
  type      = "pagerduty"
}

# Add a test to a bucket
resource "runscope_test" "api" {
  name        = "api-test"
  description = "checks the api is up and running"
  bucket_id   = runscope_bucket.main
}

resource "runscope_environment" "environment" {
    bucket_id = runscope_bucket.bucket.id
    test_id   = runscope_test.api.id
    name      = "test-environment"

    integrations = [
        data.runscope_integration.pagerduty.id
    ]

    initial_variables = {
        var1 = "true"
        var2 = "value2"
    }
}
```
